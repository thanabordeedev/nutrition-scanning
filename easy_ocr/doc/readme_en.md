## EasyOCR Demo

### 1. Recognition Demo
![demo_eurotext.png](images/demo_eurotext.png)  

```JAVA
EasyOCR e=new EasyOCR();
//Direct recognition images Content
System.out.println(e.recognize("images/demo_eurotext.png")); 
```

### 2. CAPTCHA recognition Demo

![img_INTERFERENCE_LINE.png](images/img_INTERFERENCE_LINE.png)  ![img_NORMAL.jpg](images/img_NORMAL.jpg) 

```JAVA
// Direct recognition CAPTCHA images Content
System.out.println(e.recognizeAutoCleanImage("images/img_INTERFERENCE_LINE.png",ImageType.CAPTCHA_INTERFERENCE_LINE)); 
// CAPTCHA image, through: general cleaning, automatic integration process after deformation scene, identify the content
System.out.println(e.recognizeAutoCleanImage("images/img_NORMAL.jpg", ImageType.CAPTCHA_NORMAL, 1.6, 0.7));
```


Tip: verification code image suitable deformation helps to improve the recognition rate. In special cases the proportion to be adjusted, can be observed by multiple analysis to get the right ratio.
```JAVA
for(double imageWidthRatio=0.8;imageWidthRatio<=2;imageWidthRatio+=0.1){
	for (double imageHeightRatio = 0.8;imageHeightRatio<=2.8;imageHeightRatio+=0.1) {
		System.out.println(e.recognizeAndAutoCleanImage("images/d.jpg",ImageType.CAPTCHA_NORMAL,imageWidthRatio,imageHeightRatio));
	}
}
```

### 3. API Use Demo
```Java
EasyOCR ocr = new EasyOCR();

System.out.println("###### Chinese meeting notice Content recognition ######");
ocr.setAmendPath("amend_chi.txt"); // Chinese amend
ocr.setLanguage(Language.CHI_SIM); // Chinese-Simple
String res=ocr.recognize("images/bank/notice.tif");
System.out.println(res);

System.out.println("###### Multilingual hybrid recognition ######");
ocr.setLanguage(Language.multiLanguage(Language.ENG,Language.CHI_SIM)); // Multilingual hybrid
String res2=ocr.recognize("images/bank/bill2.tif");
System.out.println(res2);

System.out.println("###### Recognition Based on EMD template Chinese bank notes ######");
ocr.setLanguage(Language.CHI_SIM); // Chinese-Simple
ocr.setTextMode(TextMode.UNIFORM_TEXT); // Uniform text
List<String> res3=ocr.recognizeByTemplate("images/bank/bill3.jpg", "images/bank/bill.etd", ImageType.BILL_NORMAL);
System.out.println(res3);

System.out.println("###### Cleanup digital content recognition with pictures ######");
ocr.setLanguage(Language.ENG); // English
ocr.setCharList("0123456789"); // Char whitelist
ocr.setTextMode(TextMode.SINGLE_LINE_TEXT); // Single line text
String res4=ocr.recognizeAutoCleanImage("images/bank/example4.jpg",ImageType.TEXT_BOLD_BLAK);
System.out.println(res4);
```

- Auto detect text regions

```Java
String filePath="./images/idcard.png";
BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(new File(filePath));

// Find Text Regions
List<TextRegion> regions = EasyOCR.findTextRegions(image,  10, 20, 70, 200);

Graphics g = image.getGraphics();
g.setColor(Color.RED);

for (TextRegion r : regions) {
//	if (r.x - 5 > 0) {
//		r.x -= 5;
//	}
    if (r.height >= 5) {
        r.y -= 5;
        r.y2 += 5;
        g.drawRect(r.x, r.y, r.x2 - r.x, r.y2 - r.y);
        g.drawRect(r.x+1, r.y+1, (r.x-r.x)-2, (r.y2-r.y)-2);
    }
}

ImageIO.write(image,filePath.substring(filePath.lastIndexOf('.')+1), new File("./images/idcard_2.png"));
```

> **OCR Tech Talk**
> 
> OCR technology to date has been relatively mature, and in some areas has been widely used, it is possible for a living convenience and breakthroughs. But on the other hand it is not better to imagine a lot of people, this technology also has its adaptation, in other broader areas, OCR is often used as an adjunct to a more efficient, while not absolutely reliable solution .
>
> For these scenarios and fields, the recognition result is Schrodinger's cat box, before human intervention to confirm the state is superimposed, both correct and not correct. So if in the case of defined scenes can not be achieved, but need to be 100 percent accurate results through OCR recognition, then in philosophy and logic is primarily a problem.
>
> A better solution behind often require more complex work, such as image cleanup, feature analysis, aids etc. knowledge and skills. OCR sometimes like a child, to have tolerance, also need guidance, correction, training, let him do better.
